## Instructions

We provide code in two sub-directories: `Offline_RL_2D` containing code for example toy 2D and offline RL experiments and `images` containing code (based on implementations of [openai/guided-diffusion](https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion)) for Imagenet experiments.
See corresponding READMEs in each folder for instructions; scripts should be run from the respective directories.
